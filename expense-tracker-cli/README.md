# Expense Tracker CLI (v3)

A simple **Command Line Expense Tracker** built with Python. This project allows users to manage daily expenses using a JSON file for persistent storage. It supports full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and automatically records the date of each expense.

This project was built as part of my Python learning journey and is designed to be clean, practical, and portfolio-ready.
