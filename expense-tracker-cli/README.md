# Expense Tracker CLI (v3)

A simple **Command Line Expense Tracker** built with Python.

This project is part of my personal learning journey in Python, where I focus on building **real, working applications** rather than isolated exercises. The goal of this project is to practice clean logic, data persistence, and real-world debugging while producing a portfolio-ready CLI application.
